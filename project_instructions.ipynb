    "## Project üöß\n",
    "You're working for Ubisoft, a French video game publisher. They'd like to release a new revolutionary video game! They have asked you to conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the video games ecosystem and today's trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals üéØ\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. Additionally, your boss has asked you to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Levels of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Macro-Level Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?**\n",
    "- **What are the best-rated games?**\n",
    "- **Are there years with more releases?** For example, were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid period?\n",
    "- **How are the prices distributed?** Are there many games with a discount?\n",
    "- **What are the most represented languages?**\n",
    "- **Are there many games prohibited for children under 16/18?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genres Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are the most represented genres?**\n",
    "- **Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?**\n",
    "- **Do some publishers have favorite genres?**\n",
    "- **What are the most lucrative genres?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?**\n",
    "- **Do certain genres tend to be preferentially available on certain platforms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flexibility of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to follow these guidelines or to choose a different angle of analysis, as long as your analysis reveals relevant and useful information. ü§ì\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of this Project üóÅÔ∏è\n",
    "You'll have to use **Databricks** and **PySpark** to conduct this EDA. Particularly, you'll have to use Databricks' visualization tool to create the visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset location:**\n",
    "  `s3://full-stack-bigdata-datasets/Big_Data/Project_Steam/steam_game_output.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helpers ü¶≠\n",
    "To help you achieve this project, here are a few tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To adopt different levels of analysis, it might be useful to create different dataframes.\n",
    "- As the dataset is semi-structured with a nested schema, PySpark's methods such as `getField()` and `explode()` may help you.\n",
    "- There are some text and date fields in this dataset: PySpark offers utility functions to manipulate these types of data efficiently. üí°\n",
    "- You can use aggregate functions and `groupBy` to conduct segmented analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable üì£\n",
    "To complete this project, you should deliver:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One or several notebooks** including data manipulation with PySpark and data visualization with Databricks' dashboarding tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To make sure the jury can view all the visualizations, please use the **\"publish\"** button on Databricks notebooks to create a public URL where a copy of your notebook will be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If Databricks notifies you that your notebook's size exceeds the maximum allowed size, split your notebook into several smaller notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Copy-paste the link(s) to your published notebooks into your GitHub repo so the jury can access it easily. üòå\n"
